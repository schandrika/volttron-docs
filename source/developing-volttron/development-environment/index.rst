An example development environment used by the VOLTTRON team would consist of a Linux VM or docker or WSL2 environment.
The following guides can be used to set up a development environment starting from creating a virtual machine
or docker container, fork the volttron repositories, installing pre-requisites and installing volttron using your
forked repository, and using an IDE to start volttron process and agents for debugging
